\section{Proposed Method}

\input{tex/figures/model.tex}
Our preliminary testing found that reading and the preprocessing stage
was very slow.
To combat this we designed a multi-processes preprocessing stage.
Here each process reads a chunk of the data and applies filtering,
feature extraction, and dimentionality reduction independently.
For filtering we use a butter worth filter with various cutoffs which are dependent on the signal in which we are processing.
For dimentionality reduction we reduce the 368 dimentions to 40 using PCA
and selecting the top 40 vectors.
Although this is a significant reduction in dimention we keep 82\% of our
original variance.
Then these processes join and are fed into 3 different classifiers.
These classifiers are independent and the output of each is measured
to see which classification algorithm best works for our problem.
If we had time we would have combined these using one of the ensamble methods.
