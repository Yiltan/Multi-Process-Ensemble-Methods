\section{Introduction}
Rescent advancements in
artificial inteligence (AI),
machine learning (ML),
and deep learning (DL)
we have seen a growth in
research using these tools to
solve problems in many different domains.
These domains include medical imaging \cite{Greenspan:2016},
wearable devices,
diverless cars,
and even scientific inverse problems \cite{laanait2019exascale}.
These tools have seen much growth in affective computing.

Resent growth in AI, ML, DL.

Dicsuss large resource requirements, We are developing on CPU
