\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
From our work we have seen that using multiple processes
for data parallellis within our machine learning model allows for significant imrpovements in the time take to run the program.
Unfortunatly this does not improve the classification performance.
The 3 different classifies Logistic Regression,
SVM, and KNN
all have the befifits and disadvantages.
We would suggests that users should use the model that more accuratly detects
the emotion that they are interested in if there were to use our code.
Our used of ensamble methods was not the best performing so again we should
ask ourselves if our previous models were overfitting and using a voting
classifier provides us with a better overall result.
