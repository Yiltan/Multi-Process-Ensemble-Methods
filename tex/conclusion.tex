\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
From our work we have seen that using multiple processes
for data parallellis within our machine learning model allows for significant imrpovements in the time take to run the program.
Unfortunatly this does not improve the classification performance.
The 3 different classifies Logistic Regression,
SVM, and KNN
all have the befifits and disadvantages.
We would suggests that users should use the model that more accuratly detects
the emotion that they are interested in if there were to use our code.
One possible extension to our work would be to use ensamble methods to
combine the outputs of each of our classifiers.
This would improve our overall performance.
