In \cite{sarkar2020selfsupervised} Sarkar and Etemad
used the EEG signals from the AMIGOS dataset to classify emotions.
They used a signal transformation recoginition networks
where they learned representations of unlabled EEG signals.
These weights were then transfered to a pre-existing emotional
recognition framework.
Although there model performed better than some state of the art models
they had issues with subject independent emotion recognition.
