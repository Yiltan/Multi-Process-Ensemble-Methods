\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
From our work we have seen that using multiple processes
for data parallel within our machine learning model allows for
a significant improvement in at run-time.
Unfortunately this does not improve the classification performance.
The 4 different classifies Logistic Regression,
SVM, AdaBoost and KNN
all have the benefits and disadvantages.
We would suggests that users should use the model that more accurately detects
the emotion that they are interested in if there were to use our code.
Our used of ensemble methods was not the best performing so again we should
ask ourselves if our previous models were over-fitting and if using a voting
classifier provides us with a better overall result.
