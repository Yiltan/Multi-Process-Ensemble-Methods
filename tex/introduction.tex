\section{Introduction}
With rescent advancements in
artificial inteligence (AI),
machine learning (ML),
and deep learning (DL)
we have seen a growth in
research using these tools to
solve problems in many different domains.
These domains include medical imaging \cite{Greenspan:2016},
wearable devices,
diverless cars,
and even scientific inverse problems \cite{laanait2019exascale}.
These tools have seen much growth in affective computing.

Affective computing is a system in which it can detect the
emotional state of a human and use emotional inteligence
to interprate and interact with humans.
Understanding and interpriting human emotion is a
difficult task for computers;
its even difficult for some humans.
Using various sensing technologies such as electrocardiogram (ECG)
alows for detection of various human emotion.
Creating a mapping from these electrical signals to
distinct emotional catagories poses some problems as
these catagories such as happy or sad and not discreate.
There is often a spectrum between any two classes.

Recently Machine Learning has also been applied to wearable devices,
portable devices and IoT.
Many of these new products have multi-core chips.
ALthrough they are less powerful than traditional desktop PC
CPUs there is still potential to utilize the hardware of these devices.

In this work we aim to understand the following questions.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Can we use EEG signals to correctly detect different emotions?
    \item Can we use multiprocesing to improve performance?
\end{itemize}

This paper is structured as follows;
Section \ref{sec:background} discusses the various types of sensors
which are used in affective computing and the dataset which we will be using.
